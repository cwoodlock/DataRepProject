# Data Representation and Querying project: ChatBot

This is my submission for the Data Representation and Querying module project in GMIT.

I am Colm Woodlock, student number G00341460 and this is my submission.

## How to run Golang files

 1. First download go from: https://golang.org/dl/
 2. Then clone my github repository using git clone https://github.com/cwoodlock/DataRepProject.git
 3. Then in the Command Line cd into the directory with the go files and type:
 
    go run filename.go	

## Testing
Since this is a web application you will be able to see the result at htttp://localhost:8080

### cURL

 cURL is also an option to see the code in action, simply download cURL here : https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    
 
 Then run the command : curl -I http://localhost:8080
